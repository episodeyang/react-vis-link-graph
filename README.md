[![github](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/episodeyang/react-vis-graph-components/total.svg?style=flat-square&maxAge=2592000)]()

This component allows you to draw a linked node graph easily. The graph
component takes in the children (links and nodes) and automatically
calculates the end points for the connections and adds padding.

For live demo and example code, look at [react-vis-graph-components](http://episodeyang.com/react-vis-graph-components)

## Develop

1. First make your changes, then git commit. Use `serve-docs` to view live updated at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)
2. run `npm run build-docs`, `npm run build-static-docs`, `npm run gh-pages`. If the last `gh-pages` script doesn't work, do `npm run gh-pages-force`. This will force push to the GitHub pages branch.
3. Then remember to push to master.
